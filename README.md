This is the update of my readme file.
I am working tirelessly in this project to learn more about source code management, what is Git and GitHub?, the difference between Git and GitHub, how to create a repository, what is a README, how to write good READMEs, how to commit, how to write helpful commit messages.
Additionally, I am learning how to push code, How to pull updates, how to create a branch, how to merge branches, how to work as collaborators on a project and which files should and which files should not appear in my repo.
